Type C-c ; to get to the sidebar window again, notice the "sidebar",
"navigating" and "stapling" items are marked with an x -- these are included
when you staple files together. Type v.

Congratulations, you've just stapled together some writing! By default, the
staple view enables view-mode, because you're not actually looking at the
original files.

Type q to quit the staple view.

Go back to the sidebar and type x on the "editing stapled stuff" item to include
it, then v again.
