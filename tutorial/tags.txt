Each project item can have any number of arbitrary tags, which are
prefixed with # by default. You can change this character with the
option binder-sidebar-tags-char.

To add a tag to an item, type t and enter the tag. To remove a tag, type
T and enter the tag. These commands work either with the item at point,
or all marked items.

Type / then "tutorial" (or "tut TAB" to autocomplete) to narrow sidebar
items to only items tagged "tutorial". Now do the same again but type
"foo" to further narrow sidebar items to only items tagged "tutorial"
and "foo".

Now type \ then "bar" to exclude sidebar items tagged "bar". You should
have a sidebar with only the tutorial/tags item showing.

Filtering the sidebar using tags allows a lot of flexibility with which
project files you want to work with in the sidebar. When the sidebar
items are filtered, navigating backward/forward only considers those
items.

Type g to clear tag filters and refresh the sidebar.
