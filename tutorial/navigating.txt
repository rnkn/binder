You can navigate through project items backward and forward with C-c [
and C-c ], which means Emacs will visit each file in the project list in
succession.

Try typing C-c [ to go back to a previous file. You don't need to prefix
C-c each time, so you can type e.g. C-c [ [ ] ] ] to repeatedly navigate
backward/forward.

Come back here when you're done. The highlight in the sidebar lets you
know where you are so you don't get lost.

Type C-c ] to go to the next file.
