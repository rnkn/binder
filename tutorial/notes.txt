Each item can have notes, which are stored in the project file.

Type C-c ; to reveal this file in the sidebar and z to open its notes.

Add or change the notes and type C-c C-c (save notes and close window)
or C-x C-s (save notes without closing window). To quit the notes window
without saving the notes, type either C-c C-q or C-c C-k.

You can toggle the notes window without selecting it by typing i.

To really mix things up, open the notes window and, with it selected,
type C-c C-l. This pops the window out to be a regular window (instead
of a side-window). This command works as a toggle.

A file's notes can be edited without opening the sidebar with C-c ".

Type C-c ] to go to the next file.
