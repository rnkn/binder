By default, concatenating a project enables view-mode, because you're
not actually looking at the original files.

In the sidebar, you can toggle which items are included when
concatenating a project by typing x. Clear all inclusions with X.

Now, include the following items:

    concat
    concat-including
    concat-editing

Now type c again.
