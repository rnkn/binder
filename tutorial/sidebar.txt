Type C-c ' to toggle the sidebar on/off. Unlike C-c ; this does not
select the sidebar, but you can change this with the option
binder-sidebar-select-window.

Type C-x 2 to split this window, and C-x 1 to delete-other-windows.
Notice the sidebar is still there? It's persistent that way. It needs to
be quit explicitly by selecting and typing q or C-c ' to toggle. You can
make the sidebar not persistent with the option
binder-sidebar-persistent-window.

By default, and item in the sidebar will show:

    x * project item name    #tag1 #tag2

These things mean:

    x       the item is included when concatenating the project
    *       the item has project notes
    #str    arbitrary item tag

You can move about in the sidebar by typing n and p, < and >. You can
quickly resize the sidebar with { and }. The step with which the sidebar
is resized can be changed with option binder-sidebar-resize-window-step.

Items in a project are arranged in a linear list. You can rearrange
items with M-n and M-p. If you push this item backward, then the "next"
item after this will be the file navigating.txt.

Type C-c ] to go to the next file.
